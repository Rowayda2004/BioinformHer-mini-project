Task 4 Image No.1 and No.2

Image 1

TNF Gene located in chromosome number 6

lengh = 2772 bp

G+C content = 52.81%
A+T content = 47.19%
Therefore GC nucleotides > AT nucleotides

the frequency of nucleotides as in the Image :

A = 709
c = 680
G = 784
T = 599

Image 2
  
The graph shows the frequency of each nucleotide:

A = 25.58%
c = 24.53%
G = 28.28%
T = 21.61%
